# Sensor Nodes
Here you can find the code related to the various sensor nodes.

## Requirements
* The node shall consume less power as possible since it could be placed on a
remote or difficult to supply place.
* The wireless radio shall transmit a data packet for each type of sensor that
is connected to the node.
* The data packets shall be transmitted repeatedly for a not yet defined time
interval with updated sensor values.

*Note:* Use this folder as your workspace in your Arduino IDE settings. The
libraries folder will be automatically recognized and included in the IDE.
